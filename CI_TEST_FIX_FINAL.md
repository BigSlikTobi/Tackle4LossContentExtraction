# CI Test Fix - Final Resolution

## Issue Identified and Fixed

### Problem
The CI environment test `test_requirements_installed` was failing with:
```
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'pandas'
```

### Root Cause
The test was trying to import `pandas` and `beautifulsoup4`, but these packages were not installed in the virtual environment. While they were listed in `requirements.in`, they were missing from `requirements.txt`.

### Solution Applied

1. **Updated requirements.txt**: Added the missing packages that the CI test expects:
   - `pandas>=2.0.0`
   - `beautifulsoup4>=4.12.0` 
   - `lxml>=4.9.0`

2. **Installed missing packages**: Used pip to install the required packages in the virtual environment.

### Files Modified
- `requirements.txt`: Added pandas, beautifulsoup4, and lxml dependencies

### Verification

- ✅ **Individual test**: `test_requirements_installed` now passes
- ✅ **Full CI test suite**: All 5 CI environment tests pass
- ✅ **Complete test suite**: All 89 tests in the entire project pass
- ✅ **No regressions**: No existing functionality was broken

### Test Results
```
tests/test_ci_environment.py::test_environment_variables_set PASSED
tests/test_ci_environment.py::test_python_version PASSED
tests/test_ci_environment.py::test_basic_imports PASSED
tests/test_ci_environment.py::test_requirements_installed PASSED  # ✅ FIXED
tests/test_ci_environment.py::test_mock_api_calls PASSED
```

### Dependencies Synchronized
The requirements.txt file is now properly synchronized with the packages expected by the CI test, ensuring that:
- Core data processing libraries (pandas, numpy) are available
- Web scraping libraries (beautifulsoup4, lxml) are installed
- All import tests pass successfully

## Status: ✅ RESOLVED

The failing CI test has been fixed and all tests in the project are now passing. The environment is properly configured with all required dependencies.
