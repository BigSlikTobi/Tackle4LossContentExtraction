They drafted [Matthew Golden](https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/46079215/<https:/www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4701936/matthew-golden>) in the first round to add a potential true No. 1 WR to Love\\\\'s already deep wide receiver corps.

And of their seven losses last season, six came to the Lions, Vikings and Eagles -- the top three teams in the NFC. If the Packers can improve their performance against the league\\\\'s top contenders and Love can stay healthy, they are set up to win a lot of games this season. And if they do that, their quarterback is going to be a top MVP candidate.\"\n        ],\n        \"error\": false\n    },\n    {\n        \"index\": 6,\n        \"tags\": [\n            \"team_prediction\"\n        ],\n        \"content\": [\n            \"## [Minnesota Vikings](https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/46079215/</nfl/team/_/name/min/minnesota-vikings>)\",\n            \"**Don\\\\'t be surprised if ...[Jordan Mason](https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/46079215/<https:/www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4360569/jordan-mason>) leads the team in rushing.**\",\n            \"**What I\\\\'m hearing:** The Vikings love [Aaron Jones Sr](https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/46079215/<https:/www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3042519/aaron-jones-sr>).

They talked about how Hopkins would grab the tablet after a drive, walk over to Worthy and teach him some of the finer details about route-running techniques. They felt Worthy\\\\'s improved performance throughout the season was due in part to Hopkins\\\\' help, and Ravens coach John Harbaugh told me when I visited their camp that he has seen similar things from Hopkins since he has been in Baltimore.

The Bengals are installing a new scheme under new defensive coordinator Al Golden, and the coaching staff made a conscious decision to put as little of that scheme on tape as possible in the televised preseason games. People who have been at practice say the first-team defense has performed fairly well against [Joe Burrow](https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/46079215/<https:/www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3915511/joe-burrow>) and one of the best offenses in the NFL -- even with defensive end [Trey Hendrickson](https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/46079215/<https:/www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3052743/trey-hendrickson>) not participating before agreeing to his [new deal](https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/46079215/</nfl/story/_/id/46073993/sources-bengals-give-trey-hendrickson-big-pay-bump-hold-in>). Cincinnati\\\\'s defense has only one direction to go after last season\\\\'s collapse. Opponents scored 25.5 points per game on the Bengals, tied for seventh most in the league. If that unit can get back to even the middle of the pack, this is a dangerous team with a potent offense and players who know how to win playoff games. As poorly as the past two seasons have gone in Cincinnati, the Bengals still managed to finish 9-8 in both of them.

There\\\\'s a deal in place that keeps me here that I\\\\'m extremely happy about.\\\\\\\"\\\\nCoach Dan Quinn gets back his leading receiver from 2024 -- when McLaurin registered 82 receptions and a career-high 13 touchdowns to go with 1,096 yards for his fifth consecutive 1,000-yard season.\\\\n\\\\\\\"I love coaching him,\\\\\\\" Quinn said. \\\\\\\"He is a rare competitor.\\\\\\\"\\\\nMcLaurin agreed to an extension with $44.65 million guaranteed and a $30 million signing bonus. If he plays out the contract, he will earn $87 million with another $9 million available to earn via incentives. But if Washington were to cut McLaurin after the 2026 season, it would save $16 million, though the team would have $18 million of dead cap money.\\\\nMcLaurin said he was happy with the deal, though it fell short of what was believed to be his asking price -- a baseline of $33 million per year with higher guarantees, according to multiple reports and league sources.\\\\n\\\\\\\"You start out one way and then you hope that it ends the way it ended,\\\\\\\" McLaurin said. \\\\\\\"It gives me the ability to continue to stay somewhere where I love but also continue to achieve things that allows me to play at a high level and prove that I\\\\'m worth what I sign for.\\\\\\\"\\\\nThere were numerous twists and turns this summer for McLaurin. He expressed deep frustration with the process during a 30-minute interview with reporters on July 15. He held out for the first four days of camp, getting fined $50,000 per day. He then held in but was placed on the physically unable to perform list because, the team said, of a lingering ankle issue. He was removed from the PUP list on Aug. 16.\\\\nIn between, McLaurin requested to be traded, a move the team expected, according to multiple team sources. But McLaurin insisted it was real.\\\\n\\\\\\\"That wasn\\\\'t something that I was doing for just leverage or just to do it or let me cause some hoopla,\\\\\\\" McLaurin said. \\\\\\\"I tried to be as intentional as possible. Am I perfect? No, I\\\\'m not. Are there some things that you think about that you maybe want to handle different or do better? Sure, that\\\\'s any situation.\\\\\\\"\\\\nBut it also was clear he wanted to stay in Washington, calling it a place he loved.\\\\n\\\\\\\"When you have two sides that want to get the deal done that are open to compromise on both ends, that\\\\'s when deals get done,\\\\\\\" McLaurin said.\\\\nMcLaurin said he met multiple times with general manager Adam Peters after reporting on July 27.\\\\n\\\\\\\"We had a lot of cool conversations,\\\\\\\" Peters said.\\\\nBut there was still a roller coaster of emotions, he said.\\\\n\\\\\\\"You get optimistic, pessimistic, all those different things throughout the process,\\\\\\\" Peters explained. \\\\\\\"But what we never lost was our love and respect and really admiration for Terry and what he does for us on and off the field.\\\\n\\\\\\\"You\\\\'ve got to do what\\\\'s best for the team but also reward someone for being a good player ... and don\\\\'t lose perspective of what this person means to our locker room, to our team.\\\\\\\"\\\\nAfter the agreement was announced Monday, Peters said he heard a commotion coming from outside his office. It was from players celebrating with McLaurin, who said he was mobbed by about 30 teammates coming into the weight room to congratulate him.\\\\n\\\\\\\"Throughout this entire process, that was the biggest gift that I probably got playing football,\\\\\\\" McLaurin said. \\\\\\\"That\\\\'s what the brotherhood is about. I hope that\\\\'s a reflection of the type of team player they feel I am.\\\\\\\"\\\\nThere was little doubt the Commanders were happy to have him back.\\\\n\\\\\\\"It\\\\'s good to have his energy [back],\\\\\\\" linebacker [Bobby Wagner](https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/46090938/<https:/www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/14979/bobby-wagner>) said.\\\\n\\\\\\\"He\\\\'s so dynamic and such a great player,\\\\\\\" center [Tyler Biadasz](https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/46090938/<https:/www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4035788/tyler-biadasz>) added. \\\\\\\"And as a leader of the group, it\\\\'s huge.\\\\\\\"\"\n        ],\n        \"error\": false\n    }\n]",

But after months of talks with the team, Hendrickson was excited to be back.\\\\n## Editor\\\\'s Picks\\\\n  * [![](https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/photo/2025/0722/r1522290_1296x1296_1-1.jpg&w=130&h=130&scale=crop&location=center)](https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/46090442/</nfl/story/_/id/46073993/sources-bengals-give-trey-hendrickson-big-pay-bump-hold-in>)\\\\n## [Bengals give star DE Hendrickson big pay bump](https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/46090442/</nfl/story/_/id/46073993/sources-bengals-give-trey-hendrickson-big-pay-bump-hold-in>)\\\\n2dBen Baby\\\\n  * [![](https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/photo/2025/0827/r1537391_2_1296x1296_1-1.jpg&w=130&h=130&scale=crop&location=center)](https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/46090442/</nfl/story/_/id/46079215/2025-nfl-surprise-predictions-32-teams-stat-leaders-breakouts-fantasy-football>)\\\\n## [Graziano: Don\\\\'t be surprised if these 32 things happen, from an MVP run to rookies who could star](https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/46090442/</nfl/story/_/id/46079215/2025-nfl-surprise-predictions-32-teams-stat-leaders-breakouts-fantasy-football>)\\\\n15hDan Graziano\\\\n  * [![](https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/photo/2025/0824/r1535894_1296x1296_1-1.jpg&w=130&h=130&scale=crop&location=center)](https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/46090442/</nfl/story/_/id/46024207/nfl-cuts-tracker-2025-live-roster-updates-all-32-teams>)\\\\n## [Who was released before the NFL cut-down deadline?

Throughout the offseason, he was adamant that he had no intention of playing on that deal. And on the eve of training camp, the Bengals\\\\' front office indicated they wanted to give him a raise.\\\\nThe two sides were at odds over the guaranteed money on the deal, including it stretching past the first season of any new contract. Aside from wide receiver [Ja\\\\'Marr Chase](https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/46090442/<https:/www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4362628/jamarr-chase>), who netted a massive $161 million extension this offseason, Cincinnati historically has not given veterans guaranteed money aside from a signing bonus.\\\\nHendrickson said the option that he agreed to wasn\\\\'t previously offered in the negotiation. When it was, he said he was \\\\\\\"incredibly humbled by it.\\\\\\\"\\\\nAnd it provided an avenue for the Bengals and him to work something out ahead of the season opener on Sept. 7 against the [Cleveland Browns](https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/46090442/</nfl/team/_/name/cle/cleveland-browns>).\\\\n\\\\\\\"I want to be a part of something special here,\\\\\\\" Hendrickson said. \\\\\\\"I\\\\'ve vocalized that pretty early and often. Again, I can\\\\'t write my own contracts. I think we\\\\'d all as players love to do that. There wasn\\\\'t one that I saw long term that I would\\\\'ve considered.\\\\\\\"\\\\nHendrickson, 30, is coming off the best season of his career. He led the NFL with 17.5 sacks, earned his first Associated Press All-Pro selection and reached the Pro Bowl for the fourth straight season since signing with the Bengals during the 2021 free agency.\\\\nThroughout his hold-in, which lasted the bulk of training camp, Hendrickson watched and observed drills.\\\\n\\\\\\\"He\\\\'s invested in the players around him,\\\\\\\" Bengals coach Zac Taylor said on Tuesday. \\\\\\\"He\\\\'s got a lot of knowledge he wants to pass down.\\\\\\\"\\\\nOn Wednesday, Hendrickson transitioned back into a playing role. When the team wrapped up its stretching period, he was the first person waiting to go through position drills with assistant coach Jerry Montgomery.\\\\n\\\\\\\"Not that I didn\\\\'t enjoy coaching, but that\\\\'s not what I\\\\'m here to do,\\\\\\\" Hendrickson said. \\\\\\\"[I\\\\'m] looking forward to getting after quarterbacks.\\\\\\\"\"\n        ],\n        \"error\": false\n    },\n    {\n        \"index\": 23,\n        \"tags\": [\n            \"footer\"\n        ],\n        \"content\": [\n            \"  * [Terms of Use](https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/46090442/<https:/disneytermsofuse.com/german/>)\\\\n  * [Privacy Policy](https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/46090442/<https:/privacy.thewaltdisneycompany.com/en/current-privacy-policy/>)\\\\n  * [Interest-Based Ads](https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/46090442/<http:/preferences-mgr.truste.com/?pid=disney01&aid=espnemea01&type=espn>)\\\\n  * [EU Privacy Rights](https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/46090442/<https:/privacy.thewaltdisneycompany.com/en/current-privacy-policy/privacy-notice/>)\\\\n  * [Cookie Policy](https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/46090442/<https:/www.espn.com/current-privacy-policy/cookies-policy/>)\\\\n  * [Manage Privacy Preferences](https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/46090442/<#>) \\\\n\u00a9 ESPN Enterprises, Inc.
